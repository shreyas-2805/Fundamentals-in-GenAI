            " Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computer systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In simple terms, it's like teaching a computer to learn and make decisions based on data.\n",

When you receive an email, your email service provider uses machine learning to identify whether the email is spam or not. The system is trained on a large dataset of spam and non-spam emails. It learns to recognize patterns and characteristics of spam emails, such as certain words, phrases, or links, and uses this knowledge to classify new emails. Over time, as more emails are processed, the system gets better at making accurate decisions, improving the effectiveness of the spam filter.\n",
