Subject: REVISED: Change of Holiday Schedule for Makara Sankranti

Dear Faculty Members and Students,
I am writing to formally announce a revision to the upcoming holiday schedule at RV University. To better align with the traditional observance of the festival, the university has decided to reschedule the Makara Sankranti holiday.
Please note that the holiday originally scheduled for Wednesday, 14th January, has been moved to Thursday, 15th January 2026. Consequently, Wednesday will now be a regular working day with all scheduled classes, laboratories, and administrative activities proceeding as usual. The university will remain closed on Thursday to allow everyone to celebrate the festivities with their families.
We kindly request all department heads to ensure that any rescheduled academic sessions or internal assessments are communicated clearly to their respective students. We apologize for any inconvenience this late adjustment may cause and appreciate your cooperation in ensuring a smooth transition for the campus schedule.
On behalf of the administration, I wish you and your families a very happy, prosperous, and joyous Makara Sankranti. May this harvest festival bring new beginnings and success to all.

Warm regards,
Registrar RV University
